Selenium Class 2

What is a WebElement?
anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
e.g. buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

HTML?
HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Model. It is a browser's internal view of the webpage.
Also called a Developer's tool or dev tools
Document--> a simple html document which represents
Object --> any line in HTML is considered to be an object
Model --> it is just a layout of the HTML

Locator
is an address or a position of a web-element on the webpage
it is used to locate or identify web-elements on the webpage

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- TagName
- xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkText
- CssSelectors
- CLassName

Why do we need so many locators?
-- developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
-- some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes
-- some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
e.g linkText and partialLinkText are only used for links

"a" tag is  also called an anchor tag

if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attributes values,
selenium will only interact with the first element it locates.
