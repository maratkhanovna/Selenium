Selenium class 04

CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) Selector:
it is another way of locating elements on the web page

Syntax:
tagname[attribute = 'attribute value']
e.g. input[value = 'LOGIN']

CSS does not give us an opportunity to locate the elements by its text

Shortcuts for CSS:
Shortcut for the className --> "."

Syntax: tagname.classNameValue
        e.g. input.button

Shortcut for ID --> "#"
Syntax: tagname#idValue
        e.g. input#txtPassword

contains() method in css:
* symbol represents contains method
tagname[attribute *= 'partial attribute value']
e.g. input[placeholder *= 'phone']

starts-with method in css:
^(Circumflex) symbol represents starts with method
tagname[attribute ^= 'starting attribute value']
e.g. input[aria-label ^= 'Pass']

end-with method in css:
$ (dollar sign) symbol represents ends-with method in css
tagname[attribute $= 'ending attribute value']
e.g. a[href $='login']

Xpath vs CSS:
-- CSS can not locate elements by text whereas Xpath can
-- CSS has shortcuts
-- Xpath does not have ends-with method
-- CSS is faster than Xpath in locating elements
-- CSS has more simple syntax than Xpath

WebElement Commands:
consists of several method where we can perform an action and get the element state
on the webpage

isEnabled() --> boolean
isDisplayed() --> boolean
isSelected() --> boolean
clear() --> void (no return type when we delete or erase something)
getText() --> String
getAttribute() --> String
submit() --> void
