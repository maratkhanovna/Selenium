Selenium Class 3

Why do we need Xpath and CSS Selector?
-- developers may not provide all the locators in HTML
-- by using Xpath ans CSS we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
-- Xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements uniquely on the web page

Types of Xpath:
Absolute Xpath --> starts from the starting node of the html
                    it always starts with a single slash (/)
                    e.g /html/body/div/div/div
Relative Xpath --> starts from any node in html
                    it always starts with double slash (//)
Syntax for Relative Xpath:
//tagname[@attribute = 'value']
e.g. //input[@id = 'email']

Identifying elements by it's text:
//tagname[text() = 'text value']
e.g. //a[text()='Create new account']
//h2[text()='Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']

Identifying elements by using contains method:
//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]
e.g. //input[contains(@placeholder, 'Email')]
//h2[contains(text(), 'the world')]

starts-with will identify elements with its partial starting value
//tagname[starts-with(@attribute, 'partial starting attribute value')]
e.g. //input[starts-with(@aria-label, 'Email')]

ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

Advanced Xpath:
is based on parent-child-sibling relationships

identifying element by following sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::siblingTagname
e.g.//input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

identifying element by preceding sibling
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling::siblingTagname
e.g. //span[text()='& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

identifying element by its parents
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent::parentTagname
//span[text()='& Orders']/parent::a

identifying element by its ancestors or predki in russian (above parent)
//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value']/ancestor::ancestorTagname
e.g. //input[@id='email']/ancestor::div

identifying element by index
(//tagname[@attribute = 'attribute value'])[index]
e.g. (//img[@class = 'ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
