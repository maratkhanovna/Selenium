Handling checkboxes and radiobuttons:
-- if you only have 1 checkbox or 1 radiobutton -> you can just click on it
-- if you have multiple choices -> you can store them in a List and loop through

DropDowns
DropDowns is a menu which gives us an opportunity to select one ot more options

Types of DropDowns:
1. Single Select
2. Multiple Select

Handling dropdowns:
1. click on dropdown and click on option
2. using Select Class
                in order to use Select class
                we need to make sure our dropdown
                has a Select tag

Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
1. by index
2. by visible text
3. by value

Whenever you interact with multiple elements you store them inside the container
such a List, Set etc..

In order to deselect the option from dropdown:
-- Make sure your dropdown is multiple select
--deselectByValue()
--deselectByIndex()
--deselectByVisibleText()
--deselectAll()
