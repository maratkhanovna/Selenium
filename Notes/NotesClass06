Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop up message. Alerts take a complete focus of our main page that we are on.
We cannot proceed further until it is handled.

3 types of Alerts:
1. Web Based Alerts/HTML Alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2. JavaScript Alerts/Browser Alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                      we cannot inspect it
3. Window Based Alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium
(e.g. when we trying to choose files from our system, it's not a part of webpage)

Types of JS alerts:
1. Simple alert - click ok
2. Confirmation alert - click ok or cancel (either cancel or click ok)
3. Prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click on cancel
3. gettext() -  get text from alert message as a String
4. sendKeys() - to enter something

Frames is a separate independent window in our webpage
Frames allows devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact or to switch to a frame
1. by index
2. by name or id
3. by WebElement

in alerts - switch to alert manually and switch back automatically
in frames - switch to alert manually and switch back to the main page manually

Interview Question:
How do you handle Alerts in Selenium? - We handle Alerts by using Alert interface
